# Racing Game (Project 0)

## Objective

Create a racing game with two players who compete for the best score. The game includes a set race time and each player must use a keystroke to increase their score during the set amount of race time.

## Technologies Used
* HTML  
* CSS
* JavaScript (jQuery)

## Code Examples

I chose to use a ```raceClock``` as an exercise in using timing functions in JavaScript. I chose to set s predetermined length of time for each race then let each player earn a score based on their ```keypress```, which is turned into a score in the JavaScript.
