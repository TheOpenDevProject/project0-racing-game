# Racing Game (Project 0)

## Objective

Create a racing game with two players who compete for the best score. The game includes a set race time and each player must use a keystroke to increase their score during the set amount of race time.

## Technologies Used
* HTML  
* CSS
* JavaScript (jQuery)

## Code Examples

I chose to use a timing event as the basis for my game to get more experience with these in JavaScript. I chose to set a predetermined length of time for each race then let each player earn a score based on their ```keypress```, which is turned into a score in the JavaScript.

The first challenge was creating a ready, set, go function so the players were ready for the clock to start instead of starting the clock immediately when the page loads.

code

```

Next game the timing event for the game length.
